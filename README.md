## Welcome to Cyclops VFX Pipeline! ##
What is Cyclops?

**Cyclops** is a suite of Open Source tools Under the MIT Licence for your **VFX pipeline**. It interacts with applications such as **Maya, Mari Nuke and RV**. It is written mostly in **python**, and uses along other packages **PySide** and **PyQt4**. Also it uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the Web Interfaces.
##Why creating this Open source Project?

The goal of this Open Source project is to develop a community of developers around **Cyclops** to expand it to a more robust, stable, complex (and yet easy to use) and more professional suite of tools available for free for everyone who wants to use it or to learn coding.
